## Overview: 
Our app uses Microsoft Azureâ€™s Computer Vision OCR to extract data on grocery expenditures from receipts and create a list of what is in the user's fridge, which can be managed through manual deletion as items are used up and can also be utilized to search for recipes based on what items are in the fridge. A separate budget tab helps users to also visualize manually-entered grocery expenditures.
This repository carries the source code for our back end.
